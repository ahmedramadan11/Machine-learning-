The attached dataset "heart.csv" contain 303 records of patients have heart disease or not according to features in it. You are required to build SVM model to predict whether patient have heart disease or not (target).
Cost Function:
Update Weights Equations:
1- If Point is correctly classified.
2- If Point is not correctly classified.
a) Split dataset into training and testing sets.
b) Try different set of features and choose the best features.
c) Try different values of learning rate and see how this changes the accuracy of the model.
d) Implement accuracy function (correctly predicted values / test set size).
